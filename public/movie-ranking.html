<h1>Darren's Favourite Movies, Shows, and Anime</h1>

<h2>My Top 3-5 Picks as of 2024</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Top Movie Picks:</h3>

<h4>Iron Man Series:</h4>
<p>
  Iron Man is one of my all time favourite movies. The story and effects <br />
  of the first movie felt ahead of its time. My personal favourite suit <br />
  was the mark 6 with the new triangle arc reactor.
</p>

<h4>Pacific Rim:</h4>
<p>
  Although the sequel to Pacific rim was a major letdown, <br />
  the first Pacific Rim was one of my all time favourites. It provided <br />
  many childhood memories and I continue to rewatch it every now and <br />
  then.
</p>

<h4>My Neighbour Totoro:</h4>
<p>
  Totoro is another classic studio ghibli film that I enjoy. The art, story,
  <br />
  and classic Joe Hisaishi music has made this one of my all time favourites.
  <br />
  Not to mention the iconic Totoro character.

<h3>Top Show Picks:</h3>

<h4>Brooklyn 99:</h4>
<p>
  Brooklyn 99 was one of the few shows aside from Kdramas that I <br />
  enjoyed a lot. Even with 8 seasons, I rewatched the entire show at <br />
  least 7 times.
</p>

<h4>How I Met Your Mother:</h4>
<p>
  How I Met Your Mother was a show that I started during my trip in <br />
  Korea. Every night at the hotel I looked forward to relaxing while <br />
  watching a few episodes of this show before bed and it quickly became <br />
  a favourite of mine.

<h3>Top Anime Picks:</h3>

<h4>Initial D:</h4>
<p>
  Initial D is the first anime that was introduced to me by my dad <br />
  and has been my favourite anime since. No other anime has taken <br />
  over the #1 spot for me. The introduction to eurobeat as well as <br />
  is something that I love about the anime.
</p>

<h4>Attack on Titan:</h4>
<p>
  Attack on Titan or AOT for short is an anime I started back in High <br />
  but have just finished the last season recently. This anime had so <br />
  many hidden messages and foreshadowing that you can only notice once <br />
  you've rewatched it making it one of my favourites. The plot was amazing
  <br />
  and I enjoyed the sountracks.
